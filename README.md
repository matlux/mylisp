# mylisp

Lisp interpreter written in Clojure, to experiment with new `clojure.specs` features for conforming and destructuring S-expressions.

## Usage

Run the REPL by executing `lein run` in the project root directory.

While in the REPL try executing the following expressions:

    (+ 1 2 3)
    ;; => 6

    (defun square (x) (* x x))
    ;; => square

    (square 5)
    ;; = > 25

    (let (x (+ 2 3)) (square x))
    ;; => 25

    (defun fact (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (fact (- n 1)))))
	;; => fact

    (fact 0)
	;; => 1

    (fact 5)
	;; => 120

Recursion is supported via Y combinator, using the `defun` macro. Enjoy!
